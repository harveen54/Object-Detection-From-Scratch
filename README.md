# Object-Detection-From-Scratch
Object Detection without using any Libraries

To Do:
* Normalize the outputs by Image Size
* Multiple objects of the same shape in an image
* Multiple objects of different shapes in an image (Say triangle and rectangle)
* Designing a classifier that can distinguish between rectangles, circles and squares
* Designing a CNN that can extract features
* Designing a Deep Learning model that can do the localization as well as classification
